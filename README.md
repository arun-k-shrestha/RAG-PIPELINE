# RAG for Earnings-Call Analysis

This project implements a **fully local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for analyzing financial transcripts such as quarterly earnings calls — **no API keys, no external dependencies, 100% offline.**

It’s ideal for privacy-preserving research, finance workflows, or anyone learning how RAG works from the ground up.
