I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\\nTim Cook : Thank you Suhasini. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from a year ago and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. And we set an all-time revenue record in services which grew 14%. At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates across our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation and investment in AI and Machine Learning. It will transform how users interact with technology, from writing tools to help you express yourself, to image playground, which gives you the ability to create fun images and communicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful, and more personal than ever. Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data and through private cloud compute, a groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud, while protecting users' information powered by Apple silicon. We are also integrating ChatGPT into experiences within iPhone, Mac, and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and we remain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives. We will continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential.

With each innovation, we're unlocking new ways of working, new ways of learning, and new ways of tapping into the unlimited promise of human potential. We are doing that across every product and every service. Now let me share more detail in our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, exceptional cameras, and unmatched power and performance. And we are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever before. This update includes the biggest redesign of the Photos app, new customization options for the home screen, messages over satellite, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, offering a transformative set of capabilities. Mac revenue was $7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Customers are loving the latest M3-powered 13 and 15 inch MacBook Air. With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus and small business owners, developers, and creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple silicon with its neural engine and privacy built in at the chip level, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI. And every Mac we've shipped with Apple silicon since 2020, is capable of taking advantage of Apple Intelligence with Mac OS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises so we continue to advance protections across our products. Turning to iPad, revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year-over-year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11 and 13 inch iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment, and so much more. And With the new iPad Pro, we pushed the boundaries of power-efficient performance with the remarkable M4 chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device.

And we're very excited that iPad Pro and iPad Air models powered by the M series of Apple silicon will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence. In wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the core of Apple Watch, are powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most, from irregular heart rhythm notifications to walking steadiness to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories motivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work. As I mentioned earlier, in services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion with paid subscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieve revenue records in the majority of the services categories with all-time revenue records in advertising, cloud, and payment services. Apple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens large and small. We're sharing powerful works of imagination with series and movies like Presumed Innocent, the Upcoming Disclaimer, and The Instigators starring Matt Damon. And we can't wait for returning fan favorites with new seasons of The Morning Show, Slow Horses, and Severance. Apple TV+ productions also continue to earn accolades with nearly 2,300 nominations and 500 wins to-date. That includes 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs our best ever showing for the upcoming awards event. During the quarter, we also expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets including Japan, Canada, Italy, and Germany, enabling more businesses to use the power of iPhone to accept contactless payments. And we announced new updates to our services coming this fall, including US national park hikes and custom walk routes and Apple Maps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ experience to help users make the most of our library of workouts and meditations. Turning to retail, we continue to expand in emerging markets with our first ever location in Malaysia. Customers from all over the country came together with our team members to celebrate this special moment. Elsewhere in the world, our teams have been sharing the magic of Apple Vision Pro and demos that delight, inspire, and deeply move customers exploring the wonders of spatial computing for the first time. At the heart of all of our innovations are the values that guide everything we do. We believe fundamentally that the best technology is technology that works for everyone.

That's why we work to minimize the amount of data we collect and work to maximize how much is processed directly on people's devices, a foundational principle that is at the core of all we build, including Apple Intelligence. And we continue to make significant progress on the environment. We are proud to say that all of our data centers, including those that will run private cloud compute, operate on 100% renewable energy. At Apple, we're constantly accelerating our pace of innovation. We are a company in relentless pursuit of big ideas. Time and again, we've seen how a spark of creativity can reach breakthrough velocity, reach across previously unexplored dimensions, and ultimately take flight in ways that can change the world. It's why we're going to keep investing in the meaningful innovation that enriches the lives of all of our customers. We have a busy time ahead of us, and I couldn't be more excited for all the amazing things yet to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\\nLuca Maestri : Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, despite 230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets, with June quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with an all-time record in developed markets and a June quarter record in emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.3% near the high end of our guidance range and down 30 basis points sequentially driven by a different mix within products which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards services and cost savings. Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable costs."}

Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74% down 60 basis points from last quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided and up 7% year-over-year. Net income was $21.4 billion, diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year-over-year and set a June quarter record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but grew on a constant currency basis. We set June quarter records across several countries, including the UK, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines. And the iPhone Active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the June quarter, many iPhone models were among the top selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top selling model in the US, urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451 Research measuring it at 98% in the US in their latest reports. Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. We saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets, with June quarter records for Mac in Latin America, India, and South Asia. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the US. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Customers are loving the latest iPad lineup for its new design and display, unparalleled performance, AI capabilities and much more. The iPad install base has continued to grow and is an all-time high, as half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch and AirPods continue to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high.

In services, total revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. We continue to have great momentum in services, as the growth of our installed base of active devices, sets a strong foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reach a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, paid subscriptions showed strong double digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. And we are constantly focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services. From critically acclaimed new content on Apple TV+ to new games on Apple Arcade and the many latest features we previewed during WWDC for iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Music, and more. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see businesses, leveraging our entire suite of products to drive productivity and creativity for their teams and customers. USAA, a leading insurance and financial services company, recently expanded beyond their existing iPhone and iPad deployments to provide their employees with the latest MacBook Air. And American Express has continued to add to their fleet of over 10,000 Macs to enhance their employees' productivity, security, and collaboration. We're also excited to see leading organizations such as Boston Children's Hospital and Lufthansa using Apple Vision Pro to build innovative spatial computing experiences to transform the training of their workforces. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $26 billion through open market repurchases of 139 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to continue to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to"}

We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\\nOperator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\nErik Woodring: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe Tim, if we start with you, you know, I thought some of the color you provided before the call about iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are, and what that translates to in potential pent-up demand, as we enter a new iPhone cycle. And I have a follow-up, thank you.\\nTim Cook: Yes, hi Eric. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency. And the 15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited about the level of value that we're going to provide to users. And we believe that -- that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.\\nErik Woodring: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, Tim. And then second, can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit? Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency, an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare that came on the back of some iPhone discounting. So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward. Thanks so"}

So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward. Thanks so much.\\nTim Cook: Yeah, Erik, as you point out, we decreased by 6.5% year-over-year for the whole of Greater China. And if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than 3%. So over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year, and so we're happy to see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also in Mainland China set a June quarter record for upgraders and so that's a very strong signal and in fact from Kantar -- the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in urban China. Also, if you look at -- one of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes all the way back to the September of 2023. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, one of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in Mainland China, the majority of customers buying or buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time and the watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying a product for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China, as it did around the world. And so we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads, but we're very confident in the long-term.\\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much.\\nTim Cook: Yeah.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Erik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Hey, Tim, you know, now that you've launched or announced Apple intelligence, do you have any ideas on how it may impact services. Would it – do you feel like it'll accelerate your Services business augmented? And maybe folks will need to buy more storage and some other things. How are you thinking about it as a catalyst for Services into next year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\\nTim Cook: We started the rollout of Apple Intelligence this week with developers, so some of the features are out there as of Monday. And we couldn't be more excited about getting them out there."}

Thanks.\\nTim Cook: We started the rollout of Apple Intelligence this week with developers, so some of the features are out there as of Monday. And we couldn't be more excited about getting them out there. Obviously, this will enable developers to take their apps to the next level. And so we are taking the first step in getting the beta out there, and we can't wait to see what kind of amazing things they do with it.\\nBen Reitzes: Okay. Thanks. And then Luca, with regard to gross margin, it's been -- there's been some component price inflation and mix. Do you mind just giving us a little more color on how you are managing that sequentially and how you feel about the current component environment as an impact on margins? Thanks.\\nLuca Maestri: Sure, Ben. I think I'll give you a bit of the walk for the June quarter and then get into the outlook that we provided for the September quarter. At the total company level, we've reported 46.3%. It is down 30 basis points sequentially, and it was really driven by a different mix. Within products, of course, we launched very important products like the iPad during the course of the quarter. But we had an offset from a shift in mix towards Services, and we got some good cost savings. And so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, we are up significantly on the margin front. And keep in mind that foreign exchange continues to be a bit of a headwind for us. As we go into the September quarter, we are guiding 45.5% to 46.5%, which is kind of within the guidance that we provided last quarter. Again similar dynamics, we expect a slightly different mix. We expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact sequentially, although a more significant impact on a year-over-year basis. On the commodity side, I think that is what you are referring to, yes we have seen some increases on the memory front, but the rest of the commodities, we see a continuous decline. So in general, we feel -- we're well positioned. And as you know well, these are very high levels of gross margin for us and we are pleased where we are.\\nBen Reitzes: Okay. Thanks a lot.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Ben. Operator may we have the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nMike Ng: Hi, good afternoon. I just have two questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk about whether or not you've seen a shift in demand for iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max models since WWDC that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for Apple Intelligence enabled phones?\\nTim Cook: We just announced the sort of the requirements at the system and the silicon level in June. And so we had very limited time during the quarter. So it's really too early to tell.\\nMike Ng: That's fair. And"}

And then with the focus on upgrader potential over the next several years, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you are expecting from the US promotional environment from your channel partners, whether that's US wireless carriers, given the importance of device sales for those partners during an upgrade cycle. Or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period? Thank you.\\nTim Cook: We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and what it brings, and it is another compelling reason for an upgrade. I'd leave the promotional question for the sort of the carriers themselves to answer. But I believe it will be a very key time for -- and a compelling upgrade cycle.\\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you Tim.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon everyone. And I have two as well. I guess, Tim, maybe back to the Apple Intelligence dynamic. There's clearly a lot of excitement from consumers around what Apple Intelligence could mean for them. Can you just touch on your -- do you think the intent is to launch all the Apple Intelligence features at the same time to consumers, or do you think they end up getting staggered a bit? And if they are staggered, do you think it impacts how consumers come out and buy the next-generation iPhone?\\nTim Cook: The rollout, as we mentioned in June, sort of -- we've actually started with developers this week. We started with some features of Apple Intelligence, not the complete suite. There are other features like languages beyond US English that will happen over the course of the year, and there are other features that will happen over the course of the year. And ChatGPT is integrated by the end of the calendar year. And so yes, so it’s a staggered launch.\\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then I guess your Services growth rates have been extremely impressive for several quarters and it seems like it is accelerated recently. Can you just touch -- talk about when you look at this double-digit growth, how much of that do you think is coming from the installed base growth versus better ARPU or better monetization of the installed base? And how do you kind of see that mix changing as you go forward?\\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Amit, it is Luca. It's a combination of a number of factors. The installed base growth is very important of course, because we have a larger pool of customers that uses the ecosystem and uses our Services. We are seeing and we've seen this consistently for many, many quarters now. We see continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem."}

We see paid accounts growing double digits, and we've seen that for many, many quarters. Now we look at our paid subscriptions on our platform, and they are growing strong double digits as well. So obviously, the growing level of engagement helps us both from an ARPU standpoint and just a volume standpoint. Obviously, as you've seen over the last several years, we launched new services over time, and we've launched many new services, fairly recently. Obviously, our payments business is relatively new, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, so many other services we've added. And so we are providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem. And we believe we are doing also a very good job at improving the quality of these services and improving the amount of content that we make available. We continue to make significant investments on TV+, on Apple Arcade. We are launching new shows, new games all the time. And I think you will continue to see that as we go forward. We are very, very happy with the 14% growth that we had this quarter because, particularly if you look at the performance that we had in Services a year ago, the compares for us tend to get a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year. But in spite of that, we delivered a level of growth that was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Amit. Operator we will take the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Tim, you announced Apple Intelligence, but you also announced partnerships with OpenAI and presumably more coming down the road. How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these potential partners. But you're obviously -- they're leveraging your distribution to your very attractive installed base. So in the long-term, do you see the Apple Intelligence part -- the Services growth from Apple Intelligence being the larger contributor over time? Or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time? And I have a follow-up.\\nTim Cook: I think the way that I look at it is that Apple Intelligence is the on-device processing and the Private Cloud Compute. And a lot of that will be things with a personal context. And then for world knowledge, we are integrating with ChatGPT initially, and that will be focused on world knowledge as I said. And so the monetization model, I don't want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they are confidential between the parties. But I"}

And so the monetization model, I don't want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they are confidential between the parties. But I see both aspects as being very important. People want both.\\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks. As a follow-up maybe for Luca. Just stepping back to the gross margin discussion again. If I look at calendar 2023, you had on average 150 basis points increase in product gross margins on a year-on-year basis. In 2024 so far, it had been more flat year-on-year. When we think about that, is the incremental headwind, I mean there was FX headwinds throughout the last several years. So ex-FX, are there other incremental headwinds that are either temporary or structural in nature that are perhaps limiting further upside to what are obviously very strong gross margins? Thank you.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. Of course, as you said, the foreign exchange continues to be -- this is incremental on a year-over-year basis. And it is one of those things that is outside of our control. We try to hedge our exposures. But it is what it is. We know that when the dollar is strong, our gross margins are affected. The other element that I think it's always important to keep in mind is that within the Products business, our products have different margin profiles. And depending on the relative success in the marketplace, our products' gross margin tends to move. And so the mix of our products has an impact on gross margins, right? And so we need to pay attention to that. Of course, we just launched an iPad and that is one of the factors. But we want all our products to be very successful in the marketplace. And that's why we always look at gross margin dollars as the first order of priority, and gross margin percentage tends to follow from that. The other factor that obviously has an impact, a significant impact is the state of the commodity markets, and they tend to go in cycles. And so we will see how that plays out over time. But in general, we feel good about the level of gross margins that we have for our products business, and we think we are in a good position there.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Wamsi. Operator, can we have the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the strong results. The first one for Luca or Tim. We keep hearing about these increasing silicon content for AI edge devices. And also, I think, Luca you spoke about increasing commodity costs. So I'm curious how to think about margins for these new AI devices. And Tim, do any of these Apple Intelligence features need more hardware updates than what we have today? And then I have a quick follow-up.\\nTim Cook:"}

And Tim, do any of these Apple Intelligence features need more hardware updates than what we have today? And then I have a quick follow-up.\\nTim Cook: Maybe I'll take the second one first and then pass it over to Luca. In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence, there are system requirements and there are silicon requirements. And so from an iPhone point of view, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence and the successor products obviously. If you look at the Mac, it starts with the M series of silicon that started in 2020. And the iPad is the same, and so it starts with the M series of silicon. And so there are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.\\nLuca Maestri: And from a gross margin standpoint, as you know, we don't provide any color past the current quarter, and we just provided guidance for the quarter 45.5% to 46.5%. It is essentially broadly in line with what we reported for the June quarter. So we'll take it quarter by quarter and we will report as the time goes by.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up for Tim. Thanks for the color on China. We also see many other consumer discretionary and luxury brands talk about a weak China. And I think Tim, you said half the details was FX related. I'm curious, the other half of the weakness, was that more China macro related or do you think it is kind of like specific to Apple with domestic competitors? Any other color you could give would be very helpful. Thank you very much.\\nTim Cook: Well, certainly, the competitive environment there is the most competitive in the world. I've said that before and that remains to be the case. The macroeconomic factors have been in the press too, and I'm not an expert on those. I can only tell you what we're seeing. And we were pleased that the business showed improvement from the first half of the year.\\nKrish Sankar: Thanks Tim.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Krish. Operator, can we have the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Two, if I may also. Tim, first one for you. I know it is early days, and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence. But when you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology, what's your instinct say in terms of -- are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications?

But when you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology, what's your instinct say in terms of -- are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications? Is there any sort of category that you think lends itself more naturally to Apple Intelligence? Is it games? Is it more creative? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it. And then I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.\\nTim Cook: If you look at how we've deployed Apple Intelligence or are deploying Apple Intelligence, we've really thought about it at pretty much all of the apps that you use every day. And so we've thought about it from Notes to Mail to Messages and all the rest. And so there is been a deep level of thinking about how it affects those apps. And that's going to surface Apple Intelligence in a way that is natural to the user, in a way that will I think, get them very excited about it and get usage. Similarly, I think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. And so I think, it is profound and we'll see what the developers do. But we're very excited to get the initial seed out there this week and see what they do. I think it will be amazing, yes.\\nDavid Vogt: Yes. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And Luca, just maybe -- I know you didn't give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. But if I kind of take your comments at face value, I guess what I'm trying to think about is for the next quarter, it sounds like with Services being relatively strong and FX easing a little bit. You are effectively saying that product revenue in the September quarter is going to basically be flat with the September quarter last year ahead of a product launch. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for, what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook particularly as you have Apple Intelligence hopefully stoking the fire for demand going forward? Thanks.\\nLuca Maestri: Well, we have provided -- let me repeat what we provided. We think that we are going to be growing total company revenue at a rate that is similar to what we reported, so the plus 5%, right? In spite of the fact that we are going to have some foreign exchange headwinds, and we said about 150 basis points in the December quarter. And we said that we will grow Services double digits at a rate that is similar to what we've reported for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. We are not going into the other categories. I think there is a lot of good math that you can do from what we've given you here. Keep in mind on the Mac that we will have a challenging compare from a year ago, given the fact that we launched and we had the full quarter impact of the launch of the MacBook Air 15-inch a year ago. And also on the iPad, we reported 24% growth in the June quarter. Clearly we had the benefit from the launch in the June quarter of the new products, the iPad Air and the iPad Pro. So important to keep that in mind on a sequential basis.\\nDavid Vogt:"}

Operator may we have the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\\nAtif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first one is for Tim. I know it's early days. The feedback on Apple Intelligence software features like notification summary and reduced interruption focus from the developers who have tried the iOS 18.1 beta version this week is very positive. My question is in response to an earlier question, you talked about a staggered launch on some of these software features. So are you expecting most of the features that you announced at WWDC to be part of iOS 18? Or we should be thinking that some of these features could potentially be part of iOS 19 next year?\\nTim Cook: Our objective that we said in June is to roll out US English starting in the fall and that is to users, and then proceed with more functionality, more features, if you will, and more languages and regions coverage as we proceed across the next year. And so we sort of gave a time frame that -- and we're tracking to that.\\nAtif Malik: Understand. And the next one for Luca. Luca the Services growth momentum seems very strong. Are you seeing any impact from changes made to comply with the DMA rules?\\nLuca Maestri: Well, as you know we have introduced some changes to the way we run the App Store in Europe already in March. And we are seeing a good level of adoption from developers on those changes. We are on an ongoing basis, discussing with the European Commission how to ensure full compliance with the DMA. It is obviously early stage, but in general, our results for the Services business and for the App Store have been pretty good until now. Again to just provide you a frame of reference, the percentage of revenue that we generate from the European Union on the App Store is about 7% of the total.\\nAtif Malik: Very helpful. Thank you.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Atif. Operator may we have the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Tim, if I can just ask you about Apple Intelligence as well. There is a regulatory aspect as well in certain geographies. You mentioned the staggered launch that you are aiming for and the timelines you're thinking. How are you thinking about the complexity of the regulatory process, in particular like EU and maybe China? And does -- in terms of your timelines of the rollout, are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect here?"}

How are you thinking about the complexity of the regulatory process, in particular like EU and maybe China? And does -- in terms of your timelines of the rollout, are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect here? And how should we think about timing then including that? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\\nTim Cook: We are engaged as you would guess, with both regulatory bodies that you mentioned. And our objective is to move as fast as we can, obviously because our objective is always to get features out there for everyone. We have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that and commit a schedule to doing that. But we're very constructively engaged with both.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. And a quick one on the Wearables category, Luca. I know you mentioned the acceleration there on a sequential basis. Maybe you can just sort of parse that out in terms of what -- which categories drove the acceleration because that's been a category that has been lagging a bit in terms of revenue trends for the past couple of quarters. So just curious what is starting to sort of drive it to accelerate on a sequential basis? Thank you.\\nTim Cook: Yes, I'll take that one. I think the important thing to remember when you look at the Wearables, Home and Accessories categories is that we have a difficult launch compare. And we've been running that for a few quarters and we still have that because last year had the continued benefit from the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the very first Watch Ultra. And so it is important to keep that in mind. If you sort of take a step back, however and look at the business across the trailing 12 months, it is grown -- the Wearables, Home and Accessories business has grown to almost $40 billion, which is double what it was five years ago.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Samik. Operator, may we have the last question please.\\nOperator: Our last question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\\nRichard Kramer: Thanks. Thanks very much. Tim, you referenced the investment in innovation, and your R&D sales ratio reached what I think was a June quarter record even before launching Apple Intelligence. Do you see the rollout of these features requiring further increases in R&D or increases in OpEx or CapEx for cloud compute capacity? And is it even possible to forecast the Services usage as they roll out, given that they are so new for consumers? Thanks.\\nTim Cook: Clearly, we have increased R&D over time. We have been investing in AI and ML for years. And in addition to investing more, we've also redeployed certain skills onto AI and ML. And so the growth in sort of embedded in our numbers that we've shared here, it is increasing year-over-year.

On the CapEx part, it is important to remember that we employ a hybrid kind of approach, where we do things internally and we have certain partners that we do business with externally where the CapEx would appear in their respective businesses. But yes, I mean you can expect that there is -- we will continue to invest and increase it year-on-year.\\nRichard Kramer: Okay. And maybe a quick follow-up for Luca. When we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months, they are up materially. And given this year's product mix, can you describe to us what exactly in the Services mix or cost control is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business?\\nLuca Maestri: Yes, I'm glad you noticed that. We are pretty pleased with that fact. And I think you probably also noticed that we've increased our return of capital to shareholders this quarter. This one was a record quarter for us. Well, it's a combination of a number of things. Of course, an improvement in the top-line helps the margin expansion that we've had over the last several years and several quarters obviously has helped. And so that is driving better operating cash flow. On the CapEx front as Tim said, we employ a hybrid model. Some of the investments show up on our balance sheet and some other investments show up somewhere else and we pay, as we go. But in general, we try to run the company efficiently. We continue to think that capital efficiency is a good thing. And therefore, we are pleased with the fact that our free cash flow is doing well this year.\\nRichard Kramer: Okay.

Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $94.9 billion, a September quarter record and up 6% from a year ago. iPhone grew in every geographic segment, marking a new September quarter revenue record for the category, and Services set an all-time revenue record, up 12% year-over-year. We also set September quarter segment revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the Rest of Asia Pacific, as well as in a large number of countries, including the United States, Brazil, Mexico, France, the UK, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. And we continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we're seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record. This has been an extraordinary year of innovation at Apple. We brought the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro to customers in February, which brings users tomorrow's technology today. And in June, we announced Apple Intelligence, a remarkable personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple innovation and redefines privacy and AI by extending our groundbreaking approach to privacy into the cloud with Private Cloud Compute. Earlier this week, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users, with systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural and conversational Siri, a more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with"}

And we look forward to additional intelligence features in December, with even more powerful Writing Tools, a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration, as well as localized English in several countries, including the UK, Australia, and Canada. These features have already been provided to developers and we're getting great feedback. More features will be rolling out in the coming months, as well as support for more languages, and this is just the beginning. Now, I'll turn to our results for the quarter, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenues set a September quarter record of $46.2 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in every geographic segment. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, we're beginning a new era for iPhone. iPhone 16, powered by A18, is equipped with an incredible new 48-megapixel Fusion camera, fantastic photo experiences, and the addition of the action button and camera control. An iPhone 16 Pro is the most advanced iPhone we've ever made, powered by A18 Pro and featuring even larger displays, an industry-leading pro camera system with camera control, and studio quality mics, all with a huge leap in battery life. Turning to Mac, revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Just this week, we brought a new generation of Apple Silicon to Mac, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. From blazing fast performance to Apple's most advanced neural engine yet, our latest chips can easily tackle incredibly complex workflows, and they ensure our newest Macs will be the best personal computers for AI the instant they hit stores. With the newest additions to our Mac lineup, customers can choose the Mac that's just right for them, whether that's iMac, the world's best and most beautiful all-in-one; MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop now with double the starting memory; MacBook Pro, the best Pro notebook anywhere; or the incredible, mighty new Mac mini, our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac. iPad revenue was $7 billion, 8% higher year-over-year. iPad is unlike any other product on the market today, and it's become an essential device in homes, schools, and businesses of all sizes. Recently, we were thrilled to introduce the newest iPad mini, featuring an ultra-compact design built for Apple Intelligence with support for Apple Pencil Pro. It's been a big year for iPad. iPad Air was popular with students and teachers as they got back to school this year, while creators are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the M4-powered iPad Pro.

In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion, down 3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we launched the all-new Apple Watch Series 10, bringing a beautiful new design and new capabilities to the world's most popular watch that make it even more powerful, intelligent, and sophisticated. It's the thinnest Apple Watch yet, making it more comfortable than ever, while offering the biggest, most advanced display. watchOS 11 brings some huge new health and fitness insights to users, including sleep apnea notifications, which help to alert people with a potentially serious but often undiagnosed condition. We're proud of the impact we make through our health innovations on watch, and I'm grateful for every note I receive about the importance of watch in people's lives. With AirPods 4, we broke a new ground in comfort and design with our best-ever open-ear headphones available for the first time with active noise cancellation. And we were especially pleased to unveil revolutionary end-to-end hearing health capabilities for AirPods Pro 2 with hearing protection, hearing test, and hearing aid features. These just became available in a software update this week, and we believe this will make a meaningful difference in our users' lives. I've already started getting notes from customers calling the experience life changing. And Apple Vision Pro continues to deliver spatial experiences that weren't possible before, including immersive entertainment like the new short film, Submerged, which gives people a view into the unique storytelling power made possible by spatial computing. Vision Pro has more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for visionOS 2, as well as applications companies are building to reimagine how they work. Vision Pro continues to inspire awe in its users, and we're just scratching the surface of what's possible. And just yesterday, we announced we're bringing Vision Pro to Korea and the UAE. As I mentioned earlier, Services achieved an all-time revenue record of $25 billion, up 12% from a year ago, and with all-time revenue records across most of our categories. With Apple TV+, we love celebrating the craft of great storytellers who know how to put on a show. Audiences love to discover new movies like Wolfs, explore acclaimed new series like Disclaimer, and dive back into returning favorites like Slow Horses and Shrinking. Apple TV+ productions have become fixtures at award shows, earning more than 2,300 nominations and more than 500 wins today. Apple also offers a live sports experience in a league of its own with MLS Season Pass, and subscribers have been cheering on their favorite teams in the MLS Cup playoffs.

Whenever we celebrate big moments, Apple Stores are the best places to share them with customers. I had an incredible time during launch day in September alongside our team at Apple Fifth Avenue, where energy and enthusiasm filled the air. And in stores all over the world, customers are eager to get a closer look at our latest innovations. We also opened two new stores during the quarter and we can't wait to bring four new stores to customers in India. We're passionate about education and believe technology has a vital role to play in both helping teachers to inspire their students and students to learn about the world around them. In honor of World Teachers' Day, Apple was proud to share new resources for teachers to engage their students in ways that aim to make learning easy and fun. Additionally, we've expanded our education grant program into 100 new schools and communities, helping with everything from access to technology, to educator resources, to scholarships and financial support. As we near the end of the year, we're proud of the progress we've made in our efforts to be carbon-neutral across our entire footprint by the end of the decade. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to introduce our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac with the latest Mac mini. And in another milestone, customers can choose a carbon-neutral option of any Apple Watch. These achievements are amazing for all of us at Apple, and we are determined to reach our 2030 goal. At Apple, across everything we do, we manage for the long term, because we're always thinking about what comes next, the next great challenge, the next innovative idea, the next big breakthrough. As we close out the year, we have the best lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season, including Apple Intelligence, which marks the start of a new chapter for our products. This is just the beginning of what we believe generative AI can do, and I couldn't be more excited for what's to come. Before I hand it over to Luca, with Luca transitioning to a new role with Apple, this will be the final time he's joining our call. So, I just wanted to take a moment to recognize his extraordinary service as Apple's CFO and to thank him for his partnership. I am deeply grateful. In his 10 years in the role, Luca has done truly exceptional work in shaping Apple as we know it today. He has helped manage Apple for the long term, thoughtfully and deliberately. He has helped us enrich the lives of so many around the world, and he has been a leader that people look up to and have learned so much from. I have incredible confidence in our incoming CFO, Kevan Parekh, and we look forward to more of you meeting and working with him going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\\nLuca"}

Serving as Apple's CFO has been a real privilege and an amazing journey, and I've greatly appreciated the support from our investors and the analyst community over the years. Kevan is exceptional, and I know you will enjoy interacting with him going forward. Let me now turn to the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We're very pleased to report a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We grew in the vast majority of the markets we track and achieved September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $70 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength around the world, reaching all-time records in both developed and emerging markets with double-digit growth and record results across most services categories. Company gross margin was 46.2%, near the high end of our guidance range. Products gross margin was 36.3%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Services gross margin was 74%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and up 6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, which relates to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court's State Aid decision. When we exclude this one-time charge, net income was $25 billion and diluted earnings per share were a $1.64, up 12% year-over-year, and a September quarter record. Operating cash flow was very strong at $26.8 billion, a new September quarter record. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and a September quarter record in total and across several markets, including the US, the Middle East, Korea, and South Asia. The iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the September quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the US, Urban China, the UK, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction for the"}

During the September quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the US, Urban China, the UK, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction for the iPhone 15 family, with 451 Research recently measuring it at 98% in the US. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in MacBook Air. Customers have been loving the performance of Apple Silicon on Mac and we are very excited to bring the latest M4 family of chips to the lineup. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with about half of customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And in the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 95% in the US. iPad generated $7 billion in revenue, up 8% year-over-year. In addition to growth in developed markets, we also saw strong performance in many emerging markets, with double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil, the Middle East, India and South Asia. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, down 3% year-over-year. The Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for watch in the US. Our Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, growing 12% year-over-year. Services continue to see strong momentum with the growth of our installed base of active devices setting a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number we had only four years ago. And as always, we remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services from new games on Apple Arcade to new features like Tap to Cash and pay with installments using Apple Pay to many successful new and returning shows on Apple TV+. This past quarter, we celebrated the five-year anniversary of Apple Card, which was ranked #1 in customer satisfaction among co-branded credit cards by J.D. Power for the fourth year in a row. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see strong demand across our products and services. NVIDIA launched its Mac as a choice program supported by AppleCare for Enterprise and Apple Professional Services with over 10,000 Macs deployed worldwide. And Novartis, a leading global pharmaceutical company, recently chose iPhone 16 as the standard mobile device for all employees.

We also see continued momentum with Apple Vision Pro in the enterprise space. UC San Diego Health is the first hospital in the world to test spatial computing apps on Apple Vision Pro in clinical trials for patient surgery in the operating room. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $157 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.6 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $7 billion, leaving us with total debt of $107 billion. As a result, net cash was $50 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $29 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect Services revenue to grow double-digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2024. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments. And our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on November 14, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2024. With that, let us open the call to questions.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\\nOperator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. I just have two. The first one is for Tim on Apple Intelligence. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on some of the early feedback to Apple Intelligence both for iOS 18.1, but also the developer beta so far, and whether you would attribute Apple Intelligence to any of the strong iPhone performance that we've seen to date.

Thanks.\\nTim Cook: Thanks, Michael. As I noted in my comments, just this week on Monday, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This includes things like systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural conversational Siri, more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies, simply by typing a description, which is really cool, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. There's also email summaries and email priority. We're getting a lot of positive feedback from developers and customers. And in fact, if you just look at the first three days, which is all we have obviously from Monday, the 18.1 adoption is twice as fast as the 17.1 adoption was in the year-ago quarter. And so, there's definitely interest out there for Apple Intelligence. Carrying on in the quarter, we are looking forward to bringing even more features in December, and this will include even more powerful Writing Tools and visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration in addition to other features, as well as we'll bring localized English to several countries that include the UK, Australia, and Canada. So, it's going to be quite a software quarter between the release on Monday and the release in December. And then, as we turn the corner to '25, we'll have more languages rolling out, starting in April as well and more features as well. And so, it's a very strong drumbeat, and we couldn't be more excited about it.\\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you very much. And my second one just for Luca. First, congratulations again, Luca, on the new role and it's been a real privilege being able to spend some time with you. A question that I think will overlap with your new role as well. Could you just talk a little bit about the CapEx outlook and whether investments in things like Private Cloud Compute could change the historical CapEx range of roughly $10 billion a year? Thank you very much.\\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Michael. On the CapEx front, I've mentioned before a number of times, we have a bit of a hybrid model in the way we run our data centers. In some cases, we use our own data centers. In some cases, we use, third-party providers. So, our CapEx numbers may not be fully comparable with others. But, obviously, we are rolling out these features, Apple Intelligence features already now, and so we are making all the capacity that is needed available for these features. You will see in our 10-K the amount of CapEx that we've incurred during the course of fiscal '24, and we will -- in fiscal '25, we will continue to make all the investments that are necessary, and of course, the investments in AI-related CapEx will be made.\\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Luca.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Mike."}

Please go ahead.\\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Tim, maybe if we start with you, I think each of the last four years you've exited the December quarter with iPhone demand outpacing supply. As we look to this quarter in the iPhone 16 cycle, lead times are relatively short. There are no known supply shortages. And I'm just curious whether you've been able to maybe get a better read on early cycle iPhone demand this year relative to past years. And if so, what you've learned about upgrade rates, switching rates, trade-ups versus trading down and being more price sensitive? And overall, any impact that Apple Intelligence may have on iPhone 16 sales? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.\\nTim Cook: There's a lot there. On Apple Intelligence, we believe it's a compelling upgrade reason. And we'll -- but we just launched it three days ago and so what we've got now from a data point point of view is the number I just referenced that 18.1 has twice the adoption rate of 17.1. So, that clearly shows a level of interest out there. In terms of exiting the December quarter with demand greater than supply, that's not my recollection that, that happened for all four of the years. We clearly had cases during COVID where there were disruptions and that's the some spilled over, but in a more regular environment where we're not having something, a 100-year flood kind of thing, we would -- our desire is to get into balance as quickly as possible. We don't want customers having to wait for products. And so, if you look at how we've done this year, we did that very quickly on the 16, on the 16 Pro family, the Pro and the Pro Max, we've been constrained in October, but we believe that soon we'll be out of constraint. And so, that's a good sign from our point of view. Keep in mind that, that's a function of supply and demand, not one side or the other. And we've been preparing for the quarter for a while. So that's what I would say there.\\nErik Woodring: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Tim.\\nTim Cook: Yeah, thank you.\\nErik Woodring: And then, Luca, if I just turn to you, obviously, it's been a pleasure working with you, and we wish you all the best in the next role.

There's plenty of debate in the market right now about input costs and commodity prices, and the impact that will have on gross margins. Historically, you do guide gross margins up 50 basis points sequentially, which you just told us about for the December quarter. So, can you maybe just help us understand your view of component prices and broadly whether you still see those as tailwinds to gross margins and how sustainable that tailwind might be, or whether that should become a headwind as we look forward? Thanks so much.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Erik. As you know, our gross margins are a factor of many, many variables. Commodities, of course, are important. They're not the only factor. But specifically on commodities, I can tell you that both for the September quarter and what we expect for the December quarter, most commodities are going to move down in price, while NAND and DRAM increased during the course of the September quarter and we expect them to increase during the December quarter. We are very pleased with the level of gross margins that we've reported during the course of the year. The entire fiscal year of '24, they're really, for our company, record levels of gross margin, and obviously guiding to 46% to 47% for the December quarter with all the new technologies that we've included in the products, with all the new features that Tim has talked about, a lot of new products across the board, I think it's a very good sign.\\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much, Luca.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes from Melius. Please go ahead.\\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. And I'll echo those comments about Luca. Miss you, and good luck. And my question is with regard to iPhone again, and with regard to the fourth quarter, is my first question -- or sorry, the fourth calendar quarter, your first quarter. When you look at mid- to low-single-digit revenue growth, do you expect the iPhone to grow faster? And what are you thinking about in the answer to that question with regard to China, which keeps improving each quarter? Thanks very much. And then, I have just a follow-up. Thanks.\\nLuca Maestri: Ben, we are not providing that level of color today. Yes, we've said that we expect total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits. Keep in mind, Apple Intelligence, as Tim said, is rolling out over time, both features and languages. And we just had a number of exciting launches just this week from the Apple Intelligence feature to the new Mac. So, we leave it at that.

Thanks, Luca. Hey, Tim, I wanted to ask you, I mean, you guys are well aware a lot of the noise out there, people chattering about builds, lead times, and you guys are guiding for mid- to low-single-digit growth. That certainly doesn't sound like alarm bells here, vis-a-vis what you guys must be hearing. And I know you guys are just running your business and doing the best you can, but you have a lot of perspective now, Tim. What are people missing here? And it certainly just sounds like -- you guys are typically conservative. That guide for revenue is certainly sounds like [this guy is certainly not falling] (ph), and you have a pretty good product cycle. So, what do you think people are missing and what are you excited about? Thanks so much, Tim.\\nTim Cook: Ben, I could not be more excited about Apple Intelligence and the rollout that we've got in front of us. I'm on the -- I'm obviously on future releases as well, working on it and it's changing my daily life. I'm super excited about the health features that we're rolling out. If the number of emails I'm already getting from customers that have taken a hearing test and are using their AirPods Pro 2 as a hearing aid, are just -- are staggering and heartwarming to read. I'm also thrilled about sleep apnea and the notification there that we'll have through the watch. This week is a very exciting week for us because we just rolled out three days -- three launches of different, Macs and desktops and laptops. And so, we have a lot of things on the docket and it's definitely the strongest lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season. In terms of the noise, I tune it out, because if not, it would just be, deafening. And so that that's what I do, I can't speak for everybody else, but that's what I do.\\nBen Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Tim. Appreciate it.\\nTim Cook: Thanks, Ben.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.

I guess the first one I have is, away from iPhones, on the Services side, you're adding $100 billion run rate with Services today, which is a phenomenal achievement by itself. As you look at the Services portfolio today, can you just talk about how much of this business do you think is reoccurring versus transactional? And are the growth rates different between the subscription portfolio over here versus transactional portfolio?\\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Amit, I'll take this one. Yes, we are, first of all, very, very happy with -- it's an important milestone. Of course, we've got to a run rate of $100 billion. You look back just a few years ago, and the growth has been phenomenal. We're very pleased. We've got a very diversified portfolio of services. And over the years, the amount that is recurring in nature has grown and is growing faster than the transactional piece. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions on our platform right now between our own services and third-party services. That continues to grow strong double-digits. So, we feel very, very good. And, essentially, to your question, yes, the recurring portion is growing faster than the transactional one.\\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. If I can just follow-up, if I look at the growth rates across the different geographies, there's always concern around China when it comes to iPhone demand, I feel, but the performance in September looks fairly good. I wonder if you just touch on, what are you seeing from a demand perspective in China? If the recent stimulus plan in China could essentially be a catalyst for iPhone? And then, EMEA really stood out with double-digit growth. Maybe you can just flush that out as well for us. Thank you.\\nTim Cook: Yeah, I'll take the China question. If you look at how we did for the quarter, we were relatively flat year-over-year. And a key component of that improvement relative to the year-over-year performance that we had been achieving is that there was a sequential improvement in foreign exchange. And so that helped us out. As you know, it's been a headwind that we've been reporting for a period of time. And -- but the other parts that are -- what else is going on there is that our installed base of the active devices reached an all-time high. We had the top two selling, smartphones in Urban China according to Kantar. The level of new customers that we have buying the products like Mac and iPad are well over 50%. Watch is over three quarters that are new to the product. And so, there's several positive signs there. In terms of the stimulus, it's a clear focus of the team there, but I'm not an economist and don't want to ad lib on the effect of it.\\nLuca Maestri: On the Europe side, Amit, a number of things.

As you see from our results during the quarter, Europe grew double-digits, 11%, and really, it was really good growth across the board, the different segments. They all did well. Keep in mind, our definition of Europe in our segment reporting includes a number of emerging markets, like Turkey, where we've grown very strongly, the Middle East. Tim mentioned a number of records in Saudi, in UAE, and we also include India where we set an all-time revenue record during the September quarter. But I have to say also Western Europe grew nicely. So, we've seen very good results for us in the entire segment.\\nAmit Daryanani: Great. Thank you very much.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks everyone for taking my question, and congratulations, Luca. I know Luca, and I know Tim, you don't want to give a lot of granularity, but if I just try to pull together your comments about what the demand environment looks like, are we to assume based on sort of the commentary that there is a risk that maybe the product revenue portfolio could be down in the December quarter if I take your numbers at face value? And if that's the risk, is that more iPhone-related, Mac-related, given the strength that you've seen in iPad related? Just trying to get a handle on kind of what potentially is giving you that degree of, I don't want to say caution, but maybe balanced for you going into the December quarter. And then, I have a follow-up.\\nLuca Maestri: As I said, David, we're not providing that level of color. We're giving you some data on services. I would repeat what I said earlier. We're very early in the cycle, very early in the cycle with a lot of new products and features that that we are launching. And we're very excited about them, but it's early. And the Apple Intelligence rollout is going to happen over time, not across the world as normally we do with software releases.\\nDavid Vogt: Right. Okay. So maybe a follow-up for, Tim. When you think about to Luca's point about the rollout being staged over the next several quarters across the world, do you think that has any impact on sort of the normal historical demand cadence across different regions? So, should we see something different, let's say, in the December quarter, the March quarter, the June quarter, et cetera, relative to history, given the timing of the rollout and where customers are probably waiting for the devices to be enabled to have the operating system? Would just love to kind of get your perspective on how we think about the demand cadence, how it might be different than maybe historically?"}

It's clearly, as you point out, a different cadence, if you will, than we would normally do. As we talked about at WWDC, we wanted to give a comprehensive vision of Apple Intelligence, and we said then that it would rollout over time. And we're right on the, what we said, at WWDC, and so we're executing well. In terms of the demand curve, I would just say that what we believe here is that it's a compelling reason for upgrading. And, it's -- that's both my personal experience and feedback that I'm getting and so we'll see. We're not projecting, beyond the current quarter obviously. We just don't do that.\\nDavid Vogt: Great.

Luca, we will miss you on these calls. Tim, maybe for you, as you think about this staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence, can you help us think through potentially how much of the global installed base of phones will have access to Apple Intelligence in their native language, in their region within the next year or maybe in the next two years? And what are some of the gating factors in the rollout? And I have a follow-up.\\nTim Cook: If you look at our schedule, we started in the -- with US English, that started on Monday. There's another release coming that adds additional features that I had referenced in December in not only US English but also localized for UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. And then, we will add more languages in April. We haven't set the specifics yet in terms of the languages, but we'll add more in April and then more as we step through the year. And so, we're moving just as fast as possible while ensuring quality. That's what we're doing.\\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim.\\nTim Cook: Yeah.\\nWamsi Mohan: And then, as a follow-up, maybe this is a little premature, but how is Apple at a high level prepared to potentially deal with any tariffs that might come post the selection cycle? And if not exactly how, perhaps you can just help investors think about some of the things Apple has done already to try to insulate from some of these impacts, potential impacts?\\nTim Cook: I wouldn't want to speculate about those sorts of things.

May we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. And again, thanks Luca for all your help with analyts and investors. My first question is on R&D. Given how much your tech peers are spending on AI, does this new era of Apple Intelligence actually require Apple to invest more in R&D beyond your current 7% to 8% of sales to capture this opportunity? And then, I had a follow-up.\\nLuca Maestri: Krish, as you know, we've been investing heavily in R&D over the last several years. Our R&D growth has been significant during the last several years. And obviously, as we move through the course of fiscal '24, we've also reallocated some of the existing resources to this new technology to AI. And so, the level of intensity that we're putting into AI has increased a lot, and you maybe don't see the full extent of it because we've also had some internal reallocation of the base of engineering resources that we have within the company.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks for that, Luca. And then, another quick follow-up. I understand Apple Intelligence is a feature on the phone today, but do you think that, in the future, it could potentially have or benefit the services growth business, or is that too -- are these too bifurcated to even make a call on the [indiscernible]? Thank you.\\nTim Cook: I think, just to keep it in mind, Apple Intelligence is also available on the Mac for the M-series products and on certain models of iPad, and in addition to the phone. And so, it's on all three. You're quite -- what was your follow-on question?\\nKrish Sankar: Tim, it does on -- can the Apple Intelligence actually help the Services growth rate?\\nTim Cook: Keep in mind that we were have released a lot of APIs and developers will be taking advantage of those APIs. That release has occurred as well and of course more are coming. And so I, definitely believe that a lot of developers will be taking advantage of Apple Intelligence in a big way. And what that does to Services, I'll not forecast, but I would say that from an ecosystem point of view, I think it will be great for the user and the user experience.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks, Tim.\\nTim Cook: Yeah.\\nSu"}

Please go ahead.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. And Luca, congrats on the new role and pleasure working with you these years. I guess, if I could, for my first one, start with mix on the iPhone side? And what I'm really curious about if you have any thoughts given that Apple Intelligence is now going to be a consistent feature set across all the four sort of iPhones on the iPhone 16 series that you launched and going back to iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. Are you seeing any change in behavior from a consumer perspective in terms of which sort of on the mix front within the iPhone series where consumer adoption is given that there's more consistency of the features when it comes to Apple Intelligence across the board? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\\nTim Cook: It's tough to answer your question, because we've been constrained in October on the Pro and the Pro Max. And so, it's really too early in the curve to call the precise mix on the consumer versus the Pro. So, we'll see.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And for my follow-up, Tim, during the quarter I think over the last 90 days, we had the quotes come out in relation to the DOJ relative to the Google sort of revenue sharing agreement that you have with them. How do you sort of look at it going forward in terms of emphasizing the role that Apple has in that ecosystem with Safari and sort of the potential outcomes that you're looking at? Thank you.\\nTim Cook: I don't want to speculate on that from a legal point of view. It's an ongoing case, and I will save that for another day.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Samik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\\nRichard Kramer: Thanks very much. My first one, Tim, I'd like to ask about some of the components in Services where despite your installed base, some parts of the Apple One bundle, like Music and News and Arcade and Fitness, are not obviously the market-leading offerings. And maybe what might change that and what other services could you call out as growing faster, having wider -- widening addressable markets like we've seen in pay or advertising?\\nTim Cook: The way that I view it is that we have lots of opportunity in all of those. And so"}

And so, there's lots of customers to try to convince to take advantage of it, and we're going to continue investing in the Services and adding new features and -- whether it's News+ or Music or Arcade, that's what we're going to do. Keep in mind that for us, we're more focused on being best than being most. And so, in some cases, not in every case, some of the services that you -- the majority of the services that you mentioned are not cross platform. We make them for our customers only and so that in some cases changes the person who's going to sell the most perhaps, but that's -- our objective is to make the best.\\nRichard Kramer: Okay, thanks. And then, Luca, one piece of unfinished business was your pledge to get to a net-neutral cash position. And over the last two years, you stayed around $50 billion of net cash. We've clearly seen instances in the past where elevated marketing spend or other programs brought increases in market share. I guess my question looking back on your tenure is, at your scale now of $57 billion of OpEx, do you still see incremental ways to put that cash to work in the business? Or will we just continue to see increased shareholder returns?\\nLuca Maestri: Well, obviously, as you've seen, our OpEx has gone up over the years. We've also seen at the same time a significant expansion in gross margin, maybe to a level that I would have not expected a few years ago, but we've done a very good job on a number of fronts. And so, I would say we -- when we plan -- every time we plan for the upcoming year, we think about all the different areas where we can deploy our resources and we make them available to grow the business. I think we've done very well over the long term and -- but our fundamental philosophy is to look after the business first. And then, if we have excess cash, we will continue to return it to our shareholders and the plan has worked quite well so far.\\nRichard Kramer: Okay. Thank you very much.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. We'll take our last question, please, operator?\\nOperator: Our last question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\\nAtif Malik: Thank you for squeezing me in. It seems to us that the spec differentiation between iPhone 16 Pro and base model isn't as big as prior years. All iPhones have new A18, A18 Pro chips and there wasn't an increase in ASPs versus last year. Can you share with us if there is a shift in your strategy in terms of...\\nOperator: Unfortunately, Mr. Malik's line has dropped.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right."}
